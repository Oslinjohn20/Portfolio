						I am fairly new to the programming industry but it always had my
						attention, I just never thought that I would be smart or good enough
						till now. I have changed my mindset and stuck to my guns, add more
						determination to get to a point where I aspire to become a full
						stack developer. I am still a junior developer for now but my goal
						doesn't stop there.
